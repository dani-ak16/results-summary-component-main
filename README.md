## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot about responsive design as that part of this project was a bit challenging.

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd want to focus more on mobile-first approaches. I'd also want to become more comfortable using CSS custom properties.
